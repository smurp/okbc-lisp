\heading{Preface}  

This document proposes a protocol for accessing knowledge bases stored
in frame representation representation systems (FRSs).  The
preliminary proposal is being circulated to seek comments and
suggestions for improvements.  Please send comments on the protocol,
keeping in mind that it does not attempt to address all computational
needs of all KB applications, and will evolve in response to input
from reviewers and implementors.

The specification that follows is a preliminary draft of the proposed
protocol.  This draft is now being circulated to FRS developers to
detect potential incompatibilities between the specification and
existing FRSs, to detect ambiguity in the specification, and to solicit general
comments and ideas.

The current specification was derived from earlier work by Barnett et al at
MCC \cite{Barnett91} and specifications used at the Stanford Knowledge Systems
Laboratory for accessing Cyc, KEE, and Epikit.  This version of the library
expands and improves upon the earlier versions in a number of respects.
